What's a web app
  -interactive program in browser
  -page vs. app
  -Web pages are living programs that can change and be changed at any time.. when this interactivity is the main focus, they are recognized as applications.
  -wikipedia vs twitter/facebook
  -do some live examples / live code in some interactivity in a site to show how the web is no longer a document viewer... it's an application platform
