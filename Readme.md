#BACKGROUND
How do browsers work? 
  -A browser is a program on your computer that makes requests to other computers on the web for files, parses their responses, and displays the information
  -Content is identified by URLs
  -DNS resolution finds the appropriate computer (say, google's web server) and asks it for a file
  -Typically this is done through a communication system called HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol
    -Dev Tools example
      -GET.. headers, etc.
      -status code, response data, response headers


  
What's a web app
  -interactive program in browser
  -page vs. app
  -Web pages are living programs that can change and be changed at any time.. when this interactivity is the main focus, they are recognized as applications.
  -wikipedia vs twitter/facebook
    -wiki: text and images, mostly static, content essentially complete upon load
    -twitter: constantly updated with new information; contents change over time or via interaction.
   

  -Intro to Dev Tools 

  -do some live examples / live code in some interactivity in a site to show how the web is no longer a document viewer... it's an application platform
  -view source
  -change css in elements pane
  -run JS in the console
  -Talk about the DOM!

  Make them do some of this with an example... maybe water.ca.gov

Where do sites come from?
  - Servers!
  - Internet Architecture lite
  - REST
 
How does mapping fit in
  - delta bathymetry catalog
  - walk through how maps function
    --Image tiles as basemap
    --SVG drawn from geometries
    --Images rendered dynamically and sent over the wire
  - How does this fit in with our understanding of client-side and server side? 

esri JS API and ArcGIS Server API
  - JS API is a bunch of JS files that knows how to write geo into SVG, pan a map, etc.
  - server API is the way to interface with the ArcGIS Server program

BRING YOUR OWN DATA

Make an app and soar.
  - Fairly free-form

-- Cadre Input --
Prereqs are taking quite a while. Might need to push back date

Two days of training would be best. One for learning, one for building one's own project
